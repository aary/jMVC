Add browser support with activities, for example when you browse off the
screen.

Add embedded activities, so that activities can have child activities.  The
only difference being that the Router will not call the lifecycle methods but
rather the activity will call its children's lifecycle methods after it has
loaded.

Make some sort of Model class through which an Activity can receive events.
So when something happens in the model class the activity will get an event.
The model also has to be linked to the AjaxRequester module (which can have
non AJAX requests) which will tell the models that have registered on it that
some events have happened.  Circular dependence here?
